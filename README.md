📘 Student Result Calculator
📌 Project Overview

Student Result Calculator is a web-based academic project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows users to enter student details and subject marks, calculates academic performance, and displays results including total marks, percentage, grade, and pass/fail status.

The result is displayed on a separate analysis page along with a graphical representation of subject-wise marks.
The project also demonstrates practical usage of Git and GitHub, including version control, branching, merging, tagging, and deployment.

🎯 Problem Formulation
